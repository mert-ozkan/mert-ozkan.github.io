I am a cognitive neuroscientist with an expertise in human visual perception and attention. In my research career, I have investigated brain-behavior correlates examining the way in which our visual system selects relevant information and the computation of these various selection strategies in the occipito–parietal cortex. My approach to research can be categorized under two main branches: hypothesis testing and data–driven analysis. I have designed various behavioral, eye–tracking, and electroencephalography (EEG) experiments and used a variety of parametric and non–parametric statistical tests and modelling approaches to answer specific research questions in regards to human behavior and perception.However, in the world of big data hypothesis–testing can only get you so far. Hence during my doctoral training, I have specialized in various supervised and unsupervised machine–learning algorithms, dimensionality reduction, and parameter optimization methods to reveal latent patterns in multimodal data. In addition to these skills, I pride myself on visualization and presentation of complex datastructures to technical and non–technical audiences. I am a quantitative scientist but am oriented towards substantial qualitative outcomes.
